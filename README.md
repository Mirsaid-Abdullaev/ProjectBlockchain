# Project Blockchain
### Written by Mirsaid Abdullaev, 2024
<p>My A Level Computer Science NEA project, completed in VB.NET using the Windows Forms application development tools in Visual Studio Community Edition, and compatible with the .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK.</p>
<p>The completed product features a suite of features available to the user, such as the generation, login and deletion
   of wallets, a bespoke LAN cross-device connection protocol using a linked-list principle, a blockchain explorer,
   ability of users to send and receive the system cryptocurrency, live transaction pool views and status of the current
   state of the network of devices as well as the device role in the network.</P>
<P>The project was accompanied by a fully documented development process across approximately 6 months alongside other A Level study, spanning the
   entire software development lifecycle: Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing and Evaluation. The PDF file of my
   final submission is saved in this repository, titled "Blockchain Wayfarer: Mirsaid Abdullaev". Click <a href="/Blockchain%20Wayfarer%20MA.pdf">here</a>
   to download the PDF file in raw format. Note - it is password protected, but I can share it if contacted.</p>
<p>As part of the development process, I have filmed a full walkthrough video showcasing my application and this can be found on Youtube
